# Configuration

## General configuration

Add `sphinx_autoissues` to the configuration value {confval}`extensions` to enable this extensions
and configure the extension:

```{eval-rst}
.. confval:: issuetracker

   The issuetracker to use.  As of now, the following trackers are
   supported:

   - ``github``: The issue tracker of https://github.com.
   - ``bitbucket``: The issue tracker of https://bitbucket.org.
   - ``launchpad``: The issue tracker of https://launchpad.net.  To use this
     issue tracker, launchpadlib_ must be installed. This tracker is not
     supported on Python 3, because launchpadlib_ is not yet available for
     Python 3.
   - ``google code``: The issue tracker of http://code.google.com.
   - ``debian``: The Debian issue tracker at http://bugs.debian.org.  To use
     this issue tracker, debianbts_ and SOAPpy_ must be installed. This issue
     tracker is not available on Python 3, because neither debianbts_ nor
     SOAPpy_ are available for Python 3 yet.
   - ``jira``: A Jira_ instance.  With this issue tracker
     :confval:`issuetracker_url` must be set to the base url of the Jira
     instance to use.  Otherwise a :exc:`~exceptions.ValueError` is raised when
     resolving the first issue reference.
   - ``redmine``: Redmine issue tracker. Before using this issuetracker, you
     must install ``python-redmine``. :confval:`issuetracker_url` must be
     set to the base url of the redmine installation. If you require
     authentication, you can either set :confval:`issuetracker_redmine_key` to
     use the key based authentication, or set
     :confval:`issuetracker_redmine_username` and
     :confval:`issuetracker_redmine_password` accordingly. You can also change
     some of the ``requests`` parameters with a dict on
     :confval:`issuetracker_redmine_requests`, for example, to disable
     SSLVerify errors on a self-signed certificate server, you can set this to
     ``{'verify': False}``.

     .. versionadded:: 0.8
```

```{eval-rst}
.. confval:: issuetracker_project

   The project inside the issue tracker or the project, to which the issue
   tracker belongs.  Defaults to the value of :confval:`project`.

   .. note::

      In case of BitBucket and GitHub, the project name must include the name
      of the user or organization, the project belongs to.  For instance, the
      project name of Sphinx_ itself is not just ``sphinx``, but
      ``birkenfeld/sphinx`` instead.  If the user name is missing, a
      :exc:`~exceptions.ValueError` will be raised when an issue is to be
      resolved the first time.

   .. versionchanged:: 0.8
      Project names must include the user name now.
```

```{eval-rst}
.. confval:: issuetracker_url

   The base url of the issue tracker::

      issuetracker = 'jira'
      issuetracker_url = 'https://studio.atlassian.com'

   Required by all issue trackers which do not only have a single instance, but
   many different instances on many different sites.

   .. versionadded:: 0.8
```

```{eval-rst}
.. confval:: issuetracker_redmine_key

   The API Key that is set on the Redmine server accounts page. If
   authentication failed, an error will be thrown and the build will fail.
```

```{eval-rst}
.. confval:: issuetracker_redmine_username

   You usually don't need this to be set if you are using the API key, but if
   you do use this, do set the password configuration value as well.
```

```{eval-rst}
.. confval:: issuetracker_redmine_password

   Works together with :confval:`issuetracker_redmine_username`.
```

```{eval-rst}
.. confval:: issuetracker_redmine_requests

   ``python-redmine`` heavily uses the ``requests`` module for all its
   communications with the redmine server. If you do need to send some values
   down to the Requests module, you need to configure this with a dict. By
   default, this is an empty dict. An useful usecase for this parameter is to
   set the ``verify`` value to ``False`` so as to disable certificate
   verification on SSL requests on self signed server, for example.
```

## Plaintext issues

```{eval-rst}
.. confval:: issuetracker_plaintext_issues

   If ``True`` (the default) issue references are extracted from plain text by
   turning issue ids like ``#10`` into references to the corresponding issue.
   Issue ids in any kind of literal text (e.g. ``inline literals`` or code
   blocks) are ignored.  If ``False``, no issue references are created from
   plain text.

   Independently of this configuration value, you can always reference issues
   explicitly with the :rst:role:`issue` role.

   .. versionadded:: 0.9
```

By default the extension looks for issue references starting with a single dash, like `#10`. You can
however change the pattern, which is used to find issue references:

```{eval-rst}
.. confval:: issuetracker_issue_pattern

   A regular expression, which is used to find and parse issue references.
   Defaults to ``r'#(\d+)'``.  If changed to ``r'gh-(\d+)'`` for instance,
   this extension would not longer recognize references like ``#10``, but
   instead parse references like ``gh-10``.  The pattern must contain only a
   single group, which matches the issue id.
```

Normally the reference title will be the whole issue id. However you can also use a custom reference
title:

```{eval-rst}
.. confval:: issuetracker_title_template

   A `format string`_ template for the title of references created from
   plaintext issue ids.  The format string gets the :class:`Issue` object
   corresponding to the referenced issue in the ``issue`` key, you may use any
   attributes of this object in your format string.  You can for instance
   include the issue title and the issue id::

      issuetracker_title_template = '{issue.title} ({issue.id})'

   If unset, the whole text matched by :confval:`issuetracker_issue_pattern` is
   used as reference title.

   .. versionadded:: 0.9
      Replaces :confval:`issuetracker_expandtitle`
